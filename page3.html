      <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>The game follows James Sunderland, who receives a letter from his deceased wife, Mary, beckoning him to return to the mysterious town of Silent Hill. Confused and grieving, James arrives in Silent Hill to search for answers about Mary's resurrection. As he explores the fog-shrouded town, he encounters disturbing creatures, enigmatic characters, and uncovers a dark, twisted history that connects to his own guilt and inner demons. James must confront his past sins and face nightmarish horrors as he journeys deeper into the town's nightmarish reality, ultimately leading to multiple possible endings based on his decisions throughout the game.</p>

      <h3>What Do I Like?</h3>
        <p>I have loved Silent Hill 2 ever since I learned about it, and honestly wish I could experience it for the first time again. I was completely absorbed by the complex storytelling and dark themes that follow topics such as mental health, grief, guilt, lust, and love. The way that the game displays these themes through characters, symbolism, atmosphere, sound, music, character development, and psychological horror interests me deeply. Although the game itself is horrifying and disturbing, to me, it also gives a sense of comfort. I believe that I feel this way personally due to the isolation in the game, the almost constant nothingness, and the mostly melancholic soundtrack.</p>
        <p>In October, 2022, Konami (the developer of Silent Hill) held a livestream event, where they revealed that there would be a remake of Silent Hill 2. The remake has not had much news since, however will be releasing exclusively for the PlayStation 5 and Windows.</p>
