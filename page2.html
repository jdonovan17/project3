      <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>The movie revolves around the life of Donnie Darko, a troubled teenager living in a suburban town. One night, Donnie narrowly escapes death when a mysterious and eerie giant rabbit named Frank appears to him and informs him that the world will end in 28 days. As Donnie tries to make sense of this disturbing revelation, he becomes increasingly entangled in a complex web of time travel and destiny. The film explores Donnie's interactions with his family, friends, and schoolmates, all of whom are dealing with their own personal struggles and issues. Donnie's journey takes a surreal turn as he navigates a series of strange and unexplained events, including encounters with a motivational speaker named Jim Cunningham, a time travel book written by a mysterious author, and a jet engine that inexplicably crashes into his house. Throughout the film, themes of mental illness, existentialism, and the blurred lines between reality and imagination are explored. </p>

      <h3>What do I like?</h3>
        <p>I have loved this movie ever since I first watched it with family at the age of 9. I learned about it from my mom, because it was my late uncle's favorite movie. My mom explained that he loved the movie and that they used to joke that Donnie had a physical likeness to my uncle. Among that, I thoroughly enjoy the complexity of the film. I enjoy that it's disturbing and downright confusing, as it makes you question everything that happens in each scene, piecing things together in an effort to make sense of it. I am a fan of darker movies that explore typically disturbing themes, and this movie is no exception. One other thing I would like to mention about this film is the vulnerability of the main character, which is uncommon in many films. The lead character is often written as strong and charismatic, but in this movie, the lead is seemingly a broken child riddled with mental issues.</p>
